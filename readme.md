# Reading a PDF

To read a PDF, you need to understand the following key features:

1. Y-axis: The Y-axis represents the probability density of the random variable. The probability density is a value that represents how likely the random variable is to take on a particular value.

2. X-axis: The X-axis represents the range of possible values that the random variable can take on.

3. Shape: The shape of the PDF can give you information about the distribution of the random variable. For example, a normal distribution has a bell-shaped curve, while a uniform distribution has a flat shape.

4. Peak: The highest point on the PDF represents the value that is most likely to be taken on by the random variable.

5. Area under the curve: The area under the curve of the PDF represents the total probability that the random variable will take on a value within the given range. The area under the curve must be equal to 1.
